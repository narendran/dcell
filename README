Steps to Reproduce our Results

These steps should be performed on the CS244 Mininet EC2 instance. We have successfully performed this experiment on a c1.medium instnace.

1. git clone https://bitbucket.org/seally_1186/dcell.git
2. cd dcell
3. git submodule update --init
4. ./run.sh
5. Wait until "Done with experiment. Please type quit()." is displayed. (This may be followed by "Killed.", which can safely be ignored.)
6. Type "quit()".
7. The plots are generated in plot.png and plot2.png.
